Course Projects for CS CM 122. Algorithms in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology.

###Programming Assignment 1 - 10 kilobase alignment

Practice sequence alignment. Check for SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism)

###Programming Assignment 2 - Megabase-scale alignment

Expand the understanding of sequencing. Mapping insertions and deletions (INDELs) are included. Implemented by [Smith–Waterman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith–Waterman_algorithm).

###Programming Assignment 3 - 10 kilobase Sequence Assembly

Conduct sequence assembly using the [De Bruijn Graph algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph)

###Programming Assignment 4 - Viral Quasispecies Assembly

Conduct quasispecies assembly on 4 known donor sequences.
